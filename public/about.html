<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Mahesh Babu Bonala, a passionate and positive-minded individual who loves to learn new things and 
  put them into action to make the world a better place. I thrive on solving real-world problems through technology, 
  always seeking innovative ways to apply my knowledge in meaningful ways</p>

<p>With a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, C, and C++, I have honed my skills through hands-on experience 
  with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and IoT applications. I’ve completed internships that deepened my understanding of embedded systems and IoT, 
  allowing me to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical implementation. Beyond academics, I enjoy taking on projects 
  that challenge me to think creatively and push boundaries. My enthusiasm for learning drives me to explore new technologies,
   attend workshops, and complete courses that expand my expertise. Above all, I believe in continuous growth and using my skills to contribute
    positively to any environment I step into</p>
